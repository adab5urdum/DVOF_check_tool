# DVOF_check_tool
<p>Arcpy Tool developed for ArcMap 10.x that checks DVOF points against TDS data and creates an output feature class as well as a check database.</p>
<p>The file is setup to be imported into an Arcmap toolbox as a script. Additional files are referenced in the mechanics of the program that are not given here.</p>
<p>If you find any of this useful, feel free to use it but the script as stands here is not complete and will not work without the additional files.</p>
